### Fixed bugs

- Fix: KEY on `(case KEYFORM ((KEY*) FORM*)*)` was evaluated though it should not
- Fix: `(apply)` would double evalute the last argument

### Generic functions

- Implement `(defgeneric)`, `(defmethod)`, and `(generic-function-p)`

### Objects

- Implement `(class-of)`, `(instancep)`, `(class)`, `(subclassp)`,
    and `(initialize-object`),
- `(create)` can create the instance of not only user-defined class,
    but also embeded-types
- `(defclass)`: support `:boundp` for slot-definition

### Condition system

- A conditiones can be implemented with a class now
- Implement `(with-handler)`, `(signal-condition)`, `(continue-condition)`,
  `(error)`, `(cerror)`, `(report-condition)`, and `<simple-error>`

Now, all of errors have not been changed to condition object

### Properties operations

- Implement `(property)`, `(set-property)`, and `(remove-property)`

### Miscellaneous

- Implement `(sqrt)` and `(with-standard-input)`
- `(defconstant)` is defined as alias of `(defglobal)` temporally
